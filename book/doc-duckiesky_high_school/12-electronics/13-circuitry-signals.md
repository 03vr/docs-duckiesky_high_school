<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: Uncompleted drone kit

Result: Ability to identify different electrical connections used on the drone and the advantages of each, know the definition of signals and where they are used on the drone
udnerstand the differences between and varying advantages of analog and digital signals, understand that values, properties, and concepts can be encoded into numbers and the purpose thereof, and know advantages of binary as a number system.

## Lesson Title
Signals and Connections

### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)



### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding


### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Hook - Observations of connectors

15 min: Explaination of connectors and types of signals

Analog signals (10min)
Encoding in voltage
Encoding in frequency
Noise (set up benefits of digital, filtering/ estimation later on)
Digital signals (20 min)
Binary
These numbers can then represent anything, e.g. letters (a=1, b=2, etc...)








### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_


### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Materials needed**

For Students: Uncompleted drone kit

For Teachers:


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: X minutes/hours


### Main Lesson

Recommended: 50 minutes

Electrical connections: crimping, connectors, splicing, soldering, PCBs (30min)
Exercise: Point out soldered connections, pull out different connectors used in the drone (e.g. from battery sense to Pi GPIO to XT-60), compare the number of pins, current capacity, etc.
Use this section as an opportunity to motivate why students need to learn to solder. This will transition the course to the next module, soldering
Besides power, electricity can be used to convey information

Analog signals (10min)
Encoding in voltage
Encoding in frequency
Noise (set up benefits of digital, filtering/ estimation later on)

Digital signals (20 min)
Binary
These numbers can then represent anything, e.g. letters (a=1, b=2, etc...)
Exercise: devise a way to represent things as one or more numbers! For example, physical properties (distance, colors, volume, etc...), other symbols, music: notes, chords, progressions, pieces, scales/modes,  intervals, etc…, sports plays, games (cards, stats, etc...)
We use base-10 (10 symbols) to represent numbers
There’s no reason we have to use 10 symbols, you can get away with just 2 -- binary! (or other numbers, eight: octal, sixteen: hexadecimal) Show ascii table with binary and decimal.
Representing symbols as high/low voltage with an undefined zone in between, mention that having only two simplifies the circuitry, reduces effects of noise
Binary in parallel and over time, two ways to represent more than one symbol, sacrificing either complexity or time
Mention electrical vs timing vs content specifications of signals, setting up future networking lessons with higher levels of abstraction


### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

Give students binary game link, and challenge them to hit the highest level!
