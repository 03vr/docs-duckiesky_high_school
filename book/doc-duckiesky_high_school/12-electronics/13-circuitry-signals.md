# Lesson 3: Signals and Connections {#electronics-circuitry-signals status=ready}

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: Uncompleted drone kit

Result: Ability to identify different electrical connections used on the drone and the advantages of each, know the definition of signals and where they are used on the drone
udnerstand the differences between and varying advantages of analog and digital signals, understand that values, properties, and concepts can be encoded into numbers and the purpose thereof, and know advantages of binary as a number system.

## Lesson Title
Signals and Connections

### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)



### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding


### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Hook - Observations of connectors

15 min: Explaination of connectors and types of signals

Analog signals (10min)
Encoding in voltage
Encoding in frequency
Noise (set up benefits of digital, filtering/ estimation later on)
Digital signals (20 min)
Binary
These numbers can then represent anything, e.g. letters (a=1, b=2, etc...)
