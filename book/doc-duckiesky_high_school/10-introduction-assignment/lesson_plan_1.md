## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES:

| Time | <img width=100000/> What will the teachers be doing/saying? |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 min  | **Introducing The Lesson**<br> <br>Pre Class:<br>Do Now: Teacher writes on the board for students to grab their drone kits and sit at their maker’s spaceHook:<br> <br>Teachers can talk about the following or their own. <ul><li>This will be students’ first step to building their own drone. It is important to learn and practice basic soldering skills here so that they can feel confident when doing more advanced soldering work later on on the drone.</li><li>It is important to prepare the grunt work so that their drone building is easier and faster.</li><li>Working here and knowing how to use maker’s tools will give students the knowledge and tools to embark on other electrical/maker projects</li></ul> |
| 4 min | **Main Lesson**<br> <br>Wire Gauges and Stripping:<ul><li>Reintroduce the 4 ESC, 4 Motor, 1 BEC and 1 Red and Brown wire pair found in the flight control box and where to find in students’ drone kit. Students should gather these materials and set them on the side.</li><li>Take one of them (that is pre tinned) and point out where to find the wire gauge.<ul><li>The gauge is written on the wire coating. It will be a number followed by AWG (American Wire Gauge).</li><li>A pre tinned wire is a wire tinned at the factory. It looks shiny on the tip and the end cannot be frayed.</li></ul></li><li>Take a wire stripper and show where the wire stripper displays its AWG number. Then take the model wire and strip it.<ul><li>You may also recommend that students use one level lower strip number if it does not work so that the wire strips easily and does not rip the internal wires.</li></ul></li><li>Take the wire cutter and show students a pre tinned wire. Now use the wire cutters to cut the pre tinned part off.<ul><li>Emphasize that all wires that are pre tinned must be cut off and re tinned.</li></ul></li><li>_Teachers now have students strip and cut the same wire as they did and answer questions._</li></ul>|
| 10 min | **Soldering Intro**<br> <br> <ul><li>Teacher explains what soldering and tinning is.<ul><li>Soldering is when two metals (solder and metal) are melted together. You use solder (show solder), to join wires. </li><li>Tinning is what you do before you solder, which is coating a metal with solder to help it join and flow electricity better to another wire.</li></ul></li><li>Teacher explains the safety components of soldering.<ul><li>Solder iron is hot, only apply to needed components, solder can fling out and is necessary to have eye protection, do not breathe in soldering fumes, the metals that the solder is next to is also hot so use helping hands or long-nose pliers.</li></ul></li><li>Teacher explains and shows how to set up the soldering station.<ul><li>Teacher turns on soldering iron and heat control.<ul><li>Each soldering iron model is different and you should know an appropriate heat to tin with.</li></ul></li><li>Teacher shows how to clean soldering iron with gold curl soldering cleaners and a sponge.</li></ul></li><li>Teacher will show how to tin using the example wire. The teacher should emphasize safety during this tutorial. You may use the 3rd video before or after your tutorial to emphasize how to tin.<ul><li>[How To Tin a Wire:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRPF4wpXX9Q) 1:30-3:00</li><li>Twist the loose wire ends into a tight twist</li><li>Hold the wire stably in place with helping hands or a plier.</li><li>Apply a solder dot onto the iron ( to increase heat transfer from the iron to the wire)</li><li>Apply the iron onto the wire about to be tinned. Wait a few seconds for the wire to heat up.</li><li>Apply the solder onto the wire **NOT THE IRON**, and let the solder melt and flow into and on the wire.</li><li>Wipe away any excess solder with the iron being careful to not fling it too aggressively so to avoid burning someone/something.</li><li>Remove the iron and clean it</li><li>Let the wire cool.</li></ul></li><li>_Teacher will circulate and answer student questions. Students will tin their first wire and ask questions_</li></ul> |
| 40 min | **Student Practice Time**<br> <br><ul><li>The teacher will have the Expectations on the board and discuss them with the students before they begin their work.</li><li>All wires for the following components must be self tinned<ul><li>4 ESCs</li><li>4 Motors</li><li>1 BEC on the IN side</li><li>Red and Brown Wire Pair in the Flight Control Box</li></ul></li><li>Teachers will circulate assisting students in completing their work.</li></ul> |
| 5 min | **Ending The Lesson**<br> <br><ul><li>Students will clean up their work space.</li><li>_Optional Exit Ticket: Students will write down what they have completed and what they need to do for the next class._</li></ul>|
