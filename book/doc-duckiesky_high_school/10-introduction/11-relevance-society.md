## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 - 10 minutes 

Do Now: In a piece of paper write down robots you are aware of in the world. How are these robots aiding communities and industries? **Teachers can search in a web browser a selected few of the students contributions to showcase them.**

Hook: Teachers can talk about the following or their own
 
- Robotics have become a seemless part of everyday life in the 21st century. As a generation raised in a technological era, we   are able to easily overlook the idea of robotics. This will be a lesson for the students on the importance of robots for the world we are accostumed to. 

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 45 minutes

A robot is a machine (especially one programmable by a computer) designed to execute one or more tasks automatically and efficiently.
Robotics is an interdisciplinary research area part of Engineering and Science. It involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The end goal is to materialize the designs of intelligent machines. Making them important for the purpose of helping and assisting humans in day to day tasks. Today robots impact everyday life in the service industry, with potential to positively transform work practices. 

By the end of the course, students will have a completed drone capable of flying with commands inputted into a terminal on their computers. 

**Insert Demo of Drone flying**

### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 5 - 10 minutes

Students should brainstorm ideas in small groups to come up with robots that could facilitate other aspects not mentioned in the lesson.
