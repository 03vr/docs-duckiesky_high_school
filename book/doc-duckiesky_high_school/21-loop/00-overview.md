# Closed Loop Control {#part:loop status=ready}

Unit Overview:

A PID (proportional, integral, derivative) controller is a control algorithm extensively used in industrial control systems to generate a control signal based on error. The error is calculated by the difference between a desired setpoint value, and a measured process variable. The goal of the controller is to minimize this error by applying a correction to the system through adjustment of a control variable. The value of the control variable is determined by three control terms: a proportional term, integral term, and derivative term.
