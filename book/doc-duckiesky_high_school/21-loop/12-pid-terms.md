## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 10 minutes/hours


Teachers go over important terms and definitions inovled with the PID (proportional, integral, derivative) controller. 


Process Variable, represented by y(t): The parameter of the system that is being monitored and controlled. 


Setpoint, represented by r(t): The desired value of the process variable.


Control Variable: The output of the controller that serves as input to the system in order to minimize error between the setpoint and the process variable. 


Steady-State Value: The final value of the process variable as time goes to infinity. 


Steady-State Error: The difference between the setpoint and the steady-state value. 


Rise Time: The time required for the process variable to rise from 10% to 90% of the steady-state value. 


Settling Time: The time required for the process variable to settle within a certain percentage of the steady-state value. 


Overshoot: The amount the process variable exceeds the setpoint, and it is expressed as a percentage.


##### Example relating to biological system: 

These terms are applicable to a biological system that we rely in. Thermoregulation relies on a negative feedback system. 

The process variable: the ____. 

### Main Lesson

Recommended: X minutes/hours

Here the teacher will go over the general algorithm: 

The error of the system $e(t)$, is calculated as the difference between setpoint and proces variable. 

So $$ e(t) = r(t) - y(t)$$


### Ending The Lesson
