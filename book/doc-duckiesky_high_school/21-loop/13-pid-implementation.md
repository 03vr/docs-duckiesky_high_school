## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: X minutes/hours

In this lesson, teachers will teach the basics about python classes, and how to implement a PID controller. 


In this part of the project, you will be implementing a PID controller for a simulated drone that can only move in one dimension, the vertical dimension. You can control the speed the motors spin on the drone, which sets the thrust being generated by the propellers. In this system, the process variable is the drone’s altitude, the setpoint is the desired altitude, and the error is the distance in meters between the setpoint and the drone’s altitude. 

### Main Lesson

Recommended: X minutes/hours

Introduce python classes::::

### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: X minutes/hours

You are ready to fly the drone!!
