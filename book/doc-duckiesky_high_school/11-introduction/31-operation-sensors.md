# Lesson 1: Sensors and Actuators {#introduction-operation-sensors status=ready}

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: 
**Hardware** - Unassembled drone kit.   
**Previous lesson** - None.

Result: 
**Knowledge** - 

- Basic components of robot hardware and software

- Your specific drone's sensors and actuators

- How the sensors and actuators interact to achieve stable flight

**Skills** - 

- The ability to identify all of the sensors and actuators of your drone

## Lesson 1: Anatomy of a Robot 


### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)



### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

Students at the end of this lesson should be able to describe the basic components of a robot and point to what everything in their drone kit is. 
<!-- Potentially could put a link to a "label the parts" kind of assesment if wanted -->


### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

1. Quick lecture about robot anatomy 

2. Comprehensive disscussion with class 

3. Going through the physical parts of the drone and labeling their use 


### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_


### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Materials needed**

For Students: The drone kit 

For Teachers: The  drone kit 

<!-- I don't think we need differentiation, advanced prep, or materials needed because this is a short lesson, but I'll leave them in there for now just in case-->


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes 

- Introduce Important Vocabulary 

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

**Sensors** - parts on a robot that allow it to _sense_, or estimate, its own conditions or environment 

**Actuators** - parts on a robot that use energy to _interact_ with its environment

**Controller** - connects the input from the sensors to create an output from the actuators in order to accomplish a goal 

</div>

- Possible Class Discussion Questions 

Q: What _sensors_ to humans have to percieve the world around them? 

A: Eyes, ears, nose, taste buds, sense of touch, etc. 

Q: What types of robots would need the same sensors you have? 

A: _Example_: Self driving cars would need to see the road like your eyes do. (answers will vary)

Q: What _actuators_ do humans have to act on the world around them? 

A: Arms, legs, fingers, muscles, etc. 

Q: How might these actuators and sensors combine (either on a human or robot) to create a more complex movement or action? 

A: _Example_: Our nose might smell something we want to walk towards, but we still have to use our eyes to make sure we aren't bumping into anything on the way. The input from our nose and eyes influence how and where our legs move to walk us towards the smell. (answers will vary)

Q: What are the _controllers_ that humans have to combine input and control action? 

A: The brain, spinal cord 

Note: This is an optional discussion based on the engagement of your class. If this seems too basic, feel free to skip through the introduction. 
<!-- this might not have to be said idk-->



### Main Lesson

Recommended: 35 minutes/hours

Note: These are the simple definitions of the parts to get a basic understanding. Everything will be described in greater detail later in the book. 

- Sensors in your drone: 

1. **Infared Sensor (IR)** - measures the distance to an object (or the ground) using infared beams, then uses the cable to report it

</figure> 

2. **Camera** - observes 2D images of the world to allow the drone to determine its planar position and speed

</figure> 

3. **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** - sensor on your flight controller (FC) that allows the drone to tell how it is accelerating and rotating in all 3 dimensions

<!-- need to put in the part about roll, pitch, yaw--> 


### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 10 minutes/hours
