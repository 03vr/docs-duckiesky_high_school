## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes/hours

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes/hours

#### Case Study: The Midair Collision in 2009

There was a collision between a private airplane and a sightseeing helicopter over Manhattan. The result was 9 deaths, of tourists and the people on the airplane. 
There were several causes that contributed to this: 
1) The limitations of the see and avoid concept:

9 seconds before collision, the helicopter was not seen from the airplane. 
5 seconds before collision, the helicopter was still very far from view. 
1 second before collision, the helicopter was too close to be able to act sufficient. 

By the time the pilot of the airplane saw the helicopter, there was no time/not sufficient enough time to avoid the helicopter. 

2) Teterboro Airport local controllerâ€™s non pertinent telephone conversation.



3) Guidelines for helicopter issued by the sightseeing company.




#### FAA rules

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is a US governmental boday that is responsible for regulating aviation and unmanned aircraft. It regulates flights outdoors. FAA rules do not apply to operations that take place indoors.  

Students are considered to be recreational users. 

Faculty and staff are considered to be non-recreational users. 

#### Where to fly:

You may fly your drone indoors if you have enough space, as FAA rules do not apply to operations that take place indoors. 

Before flying outside, please check if your _____. 

#### Possible Sources for Danger:

There are several possible sources of danger that can result from the drone: 

1) applying force to your body
2) energy discharge from the body
3) parts or propellers dislodging from the drone 
4) electric shorts and fires

#### Safe Environment

The Bystander Effect: 

The more people that are present, the less likely someone will help a victim during a situation. 
Be wary of this, make sure that if there is a dangerous situation, be cautious and aware, and take action to help those who need it.

Make sure that you have a safe environment to fly indoors. 

Make sure you have equipment: 
1) Safety glasses
2) Gloves
3) Walls
4) Distance
5) Net (not required)

#### Pre-flight Safety Checklist

Before you fly, you should make sure that: 

1) Am I connected to the correct drone?
2) Safety glasses are on?
3) Do I have space to fly? Possibilities of flying away or collisions?
4) Check the kill switch and ensure that it works
5) Are the propellers armed?

#### First Flight:

The first time you fly the drone or start the drone, there may be some situations you may experience/be aware of:

1) Drone flips (propellers are on upside down)  
2) Collisions (No side or back sensors)  
3) Battery mishaps (when the battery shorts or explodes)
