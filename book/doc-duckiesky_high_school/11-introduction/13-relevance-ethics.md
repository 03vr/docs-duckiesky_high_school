## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes/hours

Teachers introduce ethics and explain why it is significant. 


The term ethics comes from the word "ethos", which is Greek for "way of living". 


When there is a difficult situation, there are multiple possible solutions. Ethics consists of moral principles and values of a person or a group of people. It affects how we choose to live our lives, what we think is wrong and right in morals and situations, and what our responsibilities are.

By considering ethics during decision making, we can make better decisions that would benefit individuals and society as a whole.

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes/hours

Teachers will teach students about important ethical problems that are present in technology, autonomous systems, and engineering.

####Correctness/Uncertainity of Algorithms and/or Autonomous systems


By incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into systems, they gain the potential to accomplish tasks that usually rely on the intelligence of humans.

To accomplist this, AI systems utilize Deep Learning and Machine Learning, which both rely on data matching and analysis algorithms. This is beneficial as the systems can learn from past actions and decisions that have been chosen and can analyze the consequences. 

While this allows robots to learn from past experiences and permits them to constantly analyze new incoming data, the way they learn and their actions may become more unpredictable as they are given more complicated tasks that require more decision making skills (Yampolskiy). 


Example: The Boeing 777 Max

Algorithmic bias can be
