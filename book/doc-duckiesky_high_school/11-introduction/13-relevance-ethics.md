## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes/hours

Teachers introduce ethics and explain why it is significant. 


The term ethics comes from the word "ethos", which is Greek for "way of living". 


When there is a difficult situation, there are multiple possible solutions. Ethics consists of moral principles and values of a person or a group of people. It affects how we choose to live our lives, what we think is wrong and right in morals and situations, and what our responsibilities are.

By considering ethics during decision making, we can make better decisions that would benefit individuals and society as a whole.

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes/hours

Teachers will teach students about important ethical problems that are present in technology, autonomous systems, and engineering.


####Correctness and Uncertainity of Algorithms and/or Autonomous Systems


By incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into systems, they gain the potential to accomplish tasks that usually rely on the intelligence of humans. Systems can become autonomous, and do not have to rely on human control and decisions. An example of a autonomous system that is currently developing is self-driving/autonomous cars. 


AI systems utilize Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML), which both rely on data matching and analysis algorithms. 


This is beneficial as the systems can learn from past actions and decisions that have been chosen and can analyze the consequences. This also allows for decisions to be made with more clearer or transparent criteria and choices will be less influenced by human emotions.


However there are also some disadvantages to autonomous systems or relying on algorithms to make decisions. The algorithms may not represent all the factors that are related to a situation. Also, the way that AI systems learn and their actions may become more unpredictable as they are given more complicated tasks that require more decision making skills (Yampolskiy). 


#####Example: Teachers can present an example of Algorithmic inaccuracy: The Beoing 777 Max.

The Boeing 737 Max is different from the earlier Boeing 737 series because they can seat more people and fly further than before. To allow for expanded seating capacity and better engines, Boeing 737 Max had major design changes in comparison. The engines were moved forward and were raised. However, this made it more likely for the nose to pitch up while flying, so Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which corrected the nose pitching problem. However, this extra system was detrimental because pilots were unable to actually pitch up when needed and lost control/unable to control the aircraft.


####Algorithmic Bias

Algorithmic bias can result from multiple sources. 
First, it can be ____.
