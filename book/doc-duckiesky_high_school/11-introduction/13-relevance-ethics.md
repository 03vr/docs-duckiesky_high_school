####Correctness/Accuracy/Uncertainity


By incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into systems, systems may have the potential to accomplish tasks that rely on the intelligence of humans.

AI systems utilize Deep Learning and Machine Learning, which both rely on data matching and analysis algorithms. While this allows robots to learn from past experiences and allows them to constantly analyze new incoming data, the way they learn and their actions may become more unpredictable as they are given more complicated tasks that require more decision making skills (Yampolskiy).

Example: The Boeing 777 Max
