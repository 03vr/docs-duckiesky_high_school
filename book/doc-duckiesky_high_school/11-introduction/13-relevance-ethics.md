## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes/hours

Teachers introduce ethics and explain why it is significant. 


Teachers explaint the origin of the term ethics: 
The term ethics comes from the word "ethos", which is Greek for "way of living". 


Teachers explain what is ethics: 
When there is a difficult situation, there are multiple possible solutions. Ethics consists of moral principles and values of a person or a group of people. It affects how we choose to live our lives, what we think is wrong and right in morals and situations, and what our responsibilities are.

Teachers explain the importance of ethics: 
By considering ethics during decision making, we can make better decisions that would benefit individuals and society as a whole.

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes/hours

Teachers will teach students about important ethical problems that are present in technology, autonomous systems, and engineering.


#### Correctness and Uncertainty of Algorithms and/or Autonomous Systems


Teachers explain autonomous systems, AI, ML, DL, and usage of algorithms: 

By incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into systems, they gain the potential to accomplish tasks that usually rely on the intelligence of humans. Systems can become autonomous, and do not have to rely on human control and decisions. An example of an autonomous system that is currently developing is self-driving/autonomous cars. 


AI systems utilize Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML), which both rely on data matching and analysis algorithms. 


Teachers explain the benefits of AI autononous systems and the use of algorithms in decision making processes: 

There are benefits to this. 

Decisions can be made with more clearer and transparent criteria and choices will be less influenced by human emotions. The systems can learn from past actions and decisions that have been chosen and can analyze the consequences that resulted. If a result was non-favorable, then the system will remember and avoid picking the same choice for a similar future situation.

Teachers explain the disadvantages of AI autonomous systems and the use of algorithms in decision making processes: 

There are also some disadvantages to autonomous systems or relying on algorithms to make decisions. 

The algorithms may not represent all the factors that are related to a situation. There is also always chances that unexpected consequences will happen. There is no guarantee that a choice that had beneficial results in the past will still have the same result in the current scenario. 

Also, the way that AI systems learn and their actions may become more unpredictable as they are given more complicated tasks that require more decision making skills (Yampolskiy). 


##### Example: Teachers can teach about an example of Algorithmic inaccuracy: The Boeing 737 MAX.


There have been a number of accidents with the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which has resulted in the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX worldwide. 

1) Lion Air Flight 610: domestic flight that took place on October 29, 2018. It crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff. Resulted in deaths of all 189 passengers and crew. 

2) Ehiopian Airlines Flight 302: international flight that took place on March 10, 2019. It crashed shortly after takeoff, and resulted in deaths of all 157 people on the flight.  


Teachers explain why MCAS was added and how the MCAS and a faulty sensor contributed to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX. 
<!--  Pilots were not aware of what systems does/interpratibility section/training/UX for pilots training not sufficient: -->

There were several reasons that contributed to these fatal accidents:

The Boeing 737 Max is different from the earlier Boeing 737 series. To allow for expanded seating capacity and better engines, Boeing 737 Max had major design changes. The engines were moved forward and were raised. However, this made it more likely for the nose to pitch up while flying, so Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was developed to help correct the nose pitching problem by altering the control surface at the tail. The algorithm automatically detects whenever the nose pitches too high and corrects it. 

MCAS relies on only a single angle of attack sensor, instead of two. An angle of attack sensor helps warn pilots of a possibility of them losing control of the plane due to lack of lift (causing stall). Pilots are usually able to handle when the sensors are malfunctioning, however MCAS makes it a much larger problem. In both of the fatal accidents, MCAS was automatically switched on because of incorrect data from the single sensor. 

Pilots can temporarily switch MCAS off, however the system will restart and continue to work if the sensor continues to warn pilots of stalls. MCAS cannot ever been overriden by the pilots. The pilots lost control of the plane during the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air flights as the system was continuously fed inaccurate data from the sensor indicating that there are stalls, and they were unable to pitch up when needed, causing both flights to dive into the sea. 


#### Algorithmic Bias

Teachers teach that algorithmic bias can result from multiple sources. 

1) The algorithm may be programmed by someone who is biased, and inherit their biased views.

<!--  developer could be unaware of bias in dataset, ex: hand-soap dispenser -- need diverse trials, amazon-congress and criminals matching, google + apes/image matching, should these systems be released to public -->
2) Since the systems often rely on pattern matching algorithms, an algorithm may act in a biased way because of being provided data that comes from biased sources. 

3) Regarding the point made before regarding algorithmic uncertainty, from the data it receives, robots may unintentionally develop a biased and stereotypical way of thinking while trying to establish which factors it should prioritise during decision making.


##### An example: Autonomous systems and identification by skin tone

According to a study done with autonomous systems by Georgia Institute of Technology, AI systems were more consistently accurately identifying people with lighter skin tones than darker. Their results show that detection of people with darker skins were less accurate by 5%. 

This can result in racial bias by the algorithm, and in the case of autonomous cars, people with darker skin would be more likely to be harmed or involved in an accident than those with lighter skin. 

##### Another example: autonomous cars and the morality/trolley problem

 <!-- done as a game, data set is not entirely reliable -->

<!--  internet cyber security/how much trust assumption/use for good or bad are possible ; unintended uses when developing --> 

Another difficulty of autonomous cars is with the "trolley problem". MIT has created a series of questions/scenarios that involve autonoous cars. Examples include whether to ____. There are general trends found such as _____. There are also general trends found in certain cultures. Examples of this include: saving the lawful ______. 

#### Security, on time, backups, as these systems become relied upon 

There are many systems in society that utilize autonomous systems that are important to society. 
 
##### An example: Autonomous Systems Used in Social Credit System Development in China

<!-- ex: compass US, criminal scoring system: 
# close source vs open source to look for bias problems or data sets in source code --> 


##### An example: ROS/Skydio in lab example:


#### Militarization

There has been consideration of using autonomous systems for militarization. This could be for making military based decisions or using these systems to take action on made military decisions. 

<!-- discussion of ITAR, weapons, discussion of stopping war robots; robotics weapons vs chemical weapons; strong regulations? -->

##### Example: Predator drones utilized by the United States

There have been several predator drones that have been used by the United States Air Force (USAF) and Central Intelligence Ageny (CIA). 

It was initially utilized for primarily reconaissance and spying, but was later equipped to be able to engage in warfare.

It is remotely piloted. There has been many concerns regarding to human safety. 

With drone contro____. 



#### Medical, Healthcare, and Caregiver Robots

Autonomous systems have been also considered for usage in the healthcare industry. 

This includes the uses of robots to help with medical diagnosis, treatment, or surgery. 

It also includes the uses of robots to help keep elderly, disabled, young children, or patients company and to surpervise them. 

This presents an important topic: the interactions between humans and robots. Robots do not have emotions. This may present several ethical concerns:

<!-- privacy/security -->
<!-- robot trust/human-robot interaction, robot capabilities, emergency exit robot study Georgia tech Howard study, -->

1) 

#### Availability/Accessibility

<!-- UN guidelines for emergency uses + drones Humanitarian drone guidelines ; ethics: universal declaration of human rights -->

The cost of autonomous systems may be high depending on the purpose of the robot, and how regulated it is. 

The -___. 

#### Future impact of AI on human jobs and responsibilities

With the further development of technology ____.
