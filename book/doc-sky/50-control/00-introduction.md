# Control {#part:introduction status=ready}

Now that you've created a UKF to estimate your robot's state, you can control it's state using controller based on control theory. There are many types of controllers that vary in levels of detail and precision. A very simple controller which we'll be looking at in the next project is the PID controller. Many other control algorithms exist and can be applied to your drone using the data you've already collected. In this sub-section, you're going to read about a few of the other control options, and then you're going to fly an remote control (RC) drone in simulation. Flying in simulation is quite realistic, and it will give you a good feel for how difficult it is to control the drone by hand. This activity will give you a greater understanding off how much the control algorithm does to keep the drone flying steady.
