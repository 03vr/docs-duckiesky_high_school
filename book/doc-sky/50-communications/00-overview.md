# Communications {#part:communications status=ready}

This unit focuses on communications and message passing. Message passing allows
programs running on robots to communicate with other programs, both on and off
the robot. There are multiple message passing frameworks including
[zeromq](http://zeromq.org/), [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/),
and [Nvidia Isaac](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sdk).

This unit focuses on ROS. It is a framework used to program robots. It is quite
complicated, however it is widely used on both industrial and commercial
settings, and is currently the industry standard in research.
