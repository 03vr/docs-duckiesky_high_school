# Introduction {#part:introduction status=ready}


Robots are the decathalon of computer science: to make a robot work,
you need to understand robotics, which we define as a program that
includes a sensor and an actuator.  Additionally though, you typically
need to understand systems, because your robot will use multiple
computers to make its decisions; you need to understand networking to
make the computers talk; you need to worry about algorithms to make
efficient use of the computing resources and prove bounds on your
robot's behavior; and modern methods use machine learning to teach the
robots new behavior.
