# Project 3: Implementing an Altitude PID Controller {#pid-assignment status=ready}

For this project, you will be implementing a one-dimensional PID controller to control the drone's altitude (movement along the drone's z-axis), and tuning the existing planar motion PIDs. In part one, you will write your PID class and test it using a drone simulator. In part two, you will transfer your PID controller to your drone and tune the drone's planar motion and altitude PIDs to achieve stable flight.
