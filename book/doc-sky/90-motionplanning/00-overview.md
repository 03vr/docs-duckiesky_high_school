# Motion Planning {#part:motionplanning status=ready}

This unit focuses on the problem of motion planning for robotics. This is
the problem of moving through space without colliding. It typically abstracts
sensing and perception and assumes perfect ability to move in the space. The
problem is to find a trajectory through the space for the robot (which may be
a drone, a vehicle or an arm) that avoids collisions.
