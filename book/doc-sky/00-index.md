# Duckiesky {#book:duckiesky status=ready}

Flight has fascinated humans for millenia.  This module aims
to teach you everything you need to know to build and fly an
autonomous flying vehicle.  We will use the Raspberry Pi
Drone (PiDrone developed at Brown
University[](#bib:pidrone18)) to introduce concepts related to
safety, control, state estimation, networking and
communications, and mapping.

We assume you have seen some Python before, as well as some
linear algebra.  This book contains text, assignments,
projects, and slides for the course.
