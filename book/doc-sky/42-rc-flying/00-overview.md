# Fly with RC! {#part:rcflying status=ready}

In this assignment, you will fly an airplane and a quadcopter in simulation
using an RC controller. Doing so will give you an intuitive sense for roll, pitch,
and yaw, as well as how they affect the dynamics of aerial vehicles.

You will be using the RealFlight 7.5 simulator along with the associated RC
controller, which are the same controls used to fly a real physical
aircraft over RC.
